# Katapult  (formerly known as CanBoot)
 Bootloader for ARM Cortex-M MCUs

 This bootloader was initially designed for CAN nodes to be used with
 [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper).  The bootloader
 itself makes use of Klipper's hardware abstraction layer, stripped
 down to keep the footprint minimal. In addition to CAN, Katapult now
 supports USB and UART interfaces.

Currently lpc176x, stm32 and rp2040 MCUs are supported.  CAN support is currently
limited to stm32 F-series and rp2040 devices.

Katapult is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3](/LICENSE).

Note: References to CanBoot remain both in the source of this repo and
in related projects such as Klipper.  Some of these must remain indefinitely
for compatibility.  Documentation and source code references that do not break
compatibility will be updated over time.

## Building

Katapult also uses Klipper's build system.  The build is configured
with menuconfig.  The steps to fetch and build are as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/Arksine/katapult
cd katapult
make menuconfig
make
```

The menuconfig will present the following options:
- `Microcontroller Architecture`: Choose between lpc176x, stm32 and rp2040
- `Processor model`: Options depend on the chosen architecture
- `Build Katapult deployment application`: See the [deployer](#katapult-deployer)
   section below
- `Disable SWD at startup`:  This is an option for GigaDevice STM32F103
  clones.  Note that this is untested for the bootloader, GigaDevice clones
  may not work as expected.
- `Clock Reference`: Choose the appropriate setting for your board's crystal
- `Communication interface`:  Choose between CAN, USB, and UART.  Be sure
  to choose the interface with the appropriate pins for your hardware.
- For CAN Interfaces:
  - `CAN bus speed`: Select the appropriate speed for your canbus.
- For Serial (USART) Interfaces:
  - `Baud rate for serial port`:  Select the appropriate baud rate for your
    serial device.
- For USB Interfaces:
  - `USB ids`:  Allows the user to define the USB Vendor ID, Product ID,
    and/or Serial Number.
- `Support bootloader entry on rapid double click of reset button`:  When
  enabled it is possible to enter the bootloader by pressing the reset button
  twice within a 500ms window.
- `Enable bootloader entry on button (or gpio) state`:  Enable to use a gpio
  to enter the booloader.
  - `Button GPIO Pin`:  The Pin Name of te
- `Enable Status Led`: Enables the option to select a status LED gpio.
  - `Status LED GPIO Pin`:  The pin name for your LED.  The Pin can be inverted
    if the LED is on when the pin is low.  For example, the status LED Pin for a
    "blue pill" is !PC13.

Once configured and built flash with a programmer such as an ST-Link.  If you
don't have a programmer available, it should be possible to flash STM32F103
devices via UART and STM32F042/72 devices over DFU.  ST's STM32CubeProgrammer
software can facilitate all of these methods, however there are also other
tools such as `stm32flash` (UART) and `dfu-util` (USB DFU).

NOTE:  Prior to flashing Katapult it is recommended to do a full chip erase.
Doing so allows Katapult to detect that no application is present and enter
the bootloader.  This is required to enter the bootloader if you have not
configured an alternative method of entry.

NOTE RP2040: To flash rp2040 targets mcu should be rebooted in system boot mode
(usually with _BOOT_ button pressed). After that `make flash` command
could be used. You could also use rp2040 specific mass storage device
drag-and-drop method to flash `katapult.uf2` from `out` folder. Flashing Katapult
will erase main application (i.e. klipper), so it should be uploaded
with Katapult again.

## Uploading Klipper
1) Make sure the `klipper` service stopped.
2) Build Klipper with CAN support and with the a bootloader offset matching that
   of the "application offset" in Katapult.
3) Enter the bootloader.  This will occur automatically if no program is detected.
   If you built Katapult with an alternative method of entry you may use that.
   If upgrading from a currently flashed version of Klipper the `flashtool.py`
   script will command the device to enter the bootloader (currently for CAN
   devices only).
3) Run the flash script:
   For CAN Devices:
   ```
   cd ~/katapult/scripts
   python3 flashtool.py -i can0 -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -u <uuid>
   ```
   Replace <uuid> with the appropriate uuid for your can device.  If
   the device has not been previouisly flashed with Klipper, it is possible
   to query the bootloader for the UUID:

   ```
   flashtool.py -i can0 -q
   ```

   For USB/UART devices:
   Before flashing, make sure pyserial is installed.  This step only needs to
   be performed once:
   ```
   pip3 install pyserial
   ```
   ```
   python3 flashtool.py -d <serial device> -b <baud_rate>
   ```
   Replace `<serial_device>` the the path to the USB/UART device you wish to
   flash.  The `<baud_rate>` is only necessary for UART devices, and defaults
   to 250000 baud if omitted.

## Flash Tool usage

Run `scripts/flashtool.py -h` to display help:

```
usage: flashtool.py [-h] [-d <serial device>] [-b <baud rate>] [-i <can interface>]
                    [-f <klipper.bin>] [-u <uuid>] [-q] [-v] [-r]

Katapult Flash Tool

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d <serial device>, --device <serial device>
                        Serial Device
  -b <baud rate>, --baud <baud rate>
                        Serial baud rate
  -i <can interface>, --interface <can interface>
                        Can Interface
  -f <klipper.bin>, --firmware <klipper.bin>
                        Path to Klipper firmware file
  -u <uuid>, --uuid <uuid>
                        Can device uuid
  -q, --query           Query Bootloader Device IDs
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose responses
  -r, --request-bootloader
                        Requests the bootloader and exits (CAN only)
```

### Can Programming

The `-i` option defaults to `can0` if omitted.  The `uuid` option is required
for programming.  The `-q` option will query the CAN interface for unassigned
nodes, returning their UUIDs.

The `-f` option defaults to `~/klipper/out/klipper.bin` when omitted.

### Serial Programming (USB or UART)

The `-d` option is required.  The `-b` option defaults to `250000` if omitted.

### Request Bootloader (CAN Devices Only)

When the `-r` option is supplied in addition to `-u` (and optionally `-i`)
the script will request that the node enter the bootloader.  The script will
then immediately exit, no attempt will be made to upload a new binary over the
canbus.  This is particularly useful for Klipper devices running "USB to CAN
bridge mode". These devices upload firmware using DFU and/or Katapult-USB. This
option allows the user to enter the bootloader without physical access to the
board, then use the appropriate tool (`dfu-util` or `flashtool.py -d`) to
upload the new binary.

## Katapult Deployer

The Katapult deployer allows a user to overwrite their existing bootloader
with Katapult, allowing modification and updates without a programmer.  It
is *strongly* recommended that an alternate recovery (programmer, DFU, etc)
method is available in the event that something goes wrong during deployment.
If coming from a stock bootloader it is also recommended that the user create
a backup before proceeding.

To build the deployer set the `Build Katapult deployment application` option
in the menuconfig to your existing bootloader offset.  The additional settings
apply to the Katapult binary, configure them just as you would without the
deployer.  Save your settings and build with `make`.

This will result in an additional binary in the `out` folder, `deployer.bin`.
Flash `deployer.bin` with your existing bootloader (SD Card, HID, an older
version of Katapult, etc).  Once complete, the deployer should reset the
device and enter Katapult.  Now you are ready to use Katapult to flash an
application, such as Klipper.

## Contributing

Katapult is effectively a fork of Klipper's MCU source.  As such, it is appropriate
to retain similar contributing guidelines as Klipper.  Commits should be formatted
as follows:

```
filename: brief description of commit

## Notes
- It is recommended to use a USB-CAN device flashed with
  [candlelight](https://github.com/candle-usb/candleLight_fw), such as a
  [Canable](https://canable.io/). Alternatively, a device that supports Klipper's
  USB-CAN bridge mode works well.
- The BTT U2C v2.1 CAN device requires the latest firmware.  The binary can be found
  [in the U2C repo](https://github.com/bigtreetech/U2C/tree/master/firmware) and the
  source can be found at [BTT's candlelight fork](https://github.com/bigtreetech/candleLight_fw/commits/stm32g0_support).
- If using a MCP2515 CAN device (ie: Waveshare RS485 CAN HAT) it is possible
  that packets will be dropped when reading flash back from the node during
  the verification process.  That said, I have successfully tested the 12 MHz
  Crystal variant with the
  [recommended settings](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT).
- Details on the protocol used to communicate with the bootloader may
  be found in [protocol.md](protocol.md).
