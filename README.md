# CanBoot
 Bootloader for ARM Cortex-M MCUs

 This bootloader was initially designed for CAN nodes to be used with
 [Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper).  The bootloader
 itself makes use of Klipper's hardware abstraction layer, stripped
 down to keep the footprint minimal. In addition to CAN, CanBoot now
 supports USB and UART interfaces.

Currently lpc176x, stm32 and rp2040 MCUs are supported.  CAN support is currently
limited to stm32 F-series and rp2040 devices.

CanBoot is licensed under the [GNU GPL v3](/LICENSE).

## Building

CanBoot also uses Klipper's build system.  The build is configured
with menuconfig.  The steps to fetch and build are as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/Arksine/CanBoot
cd CanBoot
make menuconfig
make
```

The menuconfig will present the following options:
- `Microcontroller Architecture`: Choose between lpc176x, stm32 and rp2040
- `Processor model`: Options depend on the chosen architecture
- `Build CanBoot deployment application`: See the [deployer](#canboot-deployer)
   section below
- `Disable SWD at startup`:  This is an option for GigaDevice STM32F103
  clones.  Note that this is untested for the bootloader, GigaDevice clones
  may not work as expected.
- `Clock Reference`: Choose the appropriate setting for your board's crystal
- `Communication interface`:  Choose between CAN, USB, and UART.  Be sure
  to choose the interface with the appropriate pins for your hardware.
- For CAN Interfaces:
  - `CAN bus speed`: Select the appropriate speed for your canbus.
- For Serial (USART) Interfaces:
  - `Baud rate for serial port`:  Select the appropriate baud rate for your
    serial device.
- For USB Interfaces:
  - `USB ids`:  Allows the user to define the USB Vendor ID, Product ID,
    and/or Serial Number.
- `Support bootloader entry on rapid double click of reset button`:  When
  enabled it is possible to enter the bootloader by pressing the reset button
  twice within a 500ms window.
- `Enable bootloader entry on button (or gpio) state`:  Enable to use a gpio
  to enter the booloader.
  - `Button GPIO Pin`:  The Pin Name of te
- `Enable Status Led`: Enables the option to select a status LED gpio.
  - `Status LED GPIO Pin`:  The pin name for your LED.  The Pin can be inverted
    if the LED is on when the pin is low.  For example, the status LED Pin for a
    "blue pill" is !PC13.

Once configured and built flash with a programmer such as an ST-Link.  If you
don't have a programmer available, it should be possible to flash STM32F103
devices via UART and STM32F042/72 devices over DFU.  ST's STM32CubeProgrammer
software can facilitate all of these methods, however there are also other
tools such as `stm32flash` (UART) and `dfu-util` (USB DFU).

NOTE:  Prior to flashing CanBoot it is recommended to do a full chip erase.
Doing so allows CanBoot to detect that no application is present and enter
the bootloader.  This is required to enter the bootloader if you have not
configured an alternative method of entry.

NOTE RP2040: To flash rp2040 targets mcu should be rebooted in system boot mode
(usually with _BOOT_ button pressed). After that `make flash` command
could be used. You could also use rp2040 specific mass storage device
drag-and-drop method to flash `canboot.uf2` from `out` folder. Flashing canboot
will erase main application (i.e. klipper), so it should be uploaded
with canboot again.

## Uploading Klipper
1) Make sure the `klipper` service stopped.
2) Build Klipper with CAN support and with the a bootloader offset matching that
   of the "application offset" in CanBoot.
3) Enter the bootloader.  This will occur automatically if no program is detected.
   If you built CanBoot with an alternative method of entry you may use that.
   If upgrading from a currently flashed version of Klipper the `flash_can.py`
   script will command the device to enter the bootloader (currently for CAN
   devices only).
3) Run the flash script:
   For CAN Devices:
   ```
   cd ~/CanBoot/scripts
   python3 flash_can.py -i can0 -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin -u <uuid>
   ```
   Replace <uuid> with the appropriate uuid for your can device.  If
   the device has not been previouisly flashed with Klipper, it is possible
   to query the bootloader for the UUID:

   ```
   flash_can.py -i can0 -q
   ```

   For USB/UART devices:
   Before flashing, make sure pyserial is installed.  This step only needs to
   be performed once:
   ```
   pip3 install pyserial
   ```
   ```
   python3 flash_can.py -d <serial device> -b <baud_rate>
   ```
   Replace `<serial_device>` the the path to the USB/UART device you wish to
   flash.  The `<baud_rate>` is only necessary for UART devices, and defaults
   to 250000 baud if omitted.

## FlashCan usage

Running `flash_can.py -h` to display help:

```
usage: flash_can.py [-h] [-d <serial device>] [-b <baud rate>]
                    [-i <can interface>] [-f <klipper.bin>] [-u <uuid>] [-q]
                    [-v]

Can Bootloader Flash Utility

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d <serial device>, --device <serial device>
                        Serial Device
  -b <baud rate>, --baud <baud rate>
                        Serial baud rate
  -i <can interface>, --interface <can interface>
                        Can Interface
  -f <klipper.bin>, --firmware <klipper.bin>
                        Path to Klipper firmware file
  -u <uuid>, --uuid <uuid>
                        Can device uuid
  -q, --query           Query Bootloader Device IDs
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose responses
```

The `interface` option defaults to `can0` if omitted.  The `firmware` option
defaults to `~/klipper/out/klipper.bin`.  The `uuid` must be specified unless
the user is running a query with `-q`.

## CanBoot Deployer

The CanBoot deployer allows a user to overwrite their existing bootloader
with CanBoot, allowing modification and updates without a programmer.  It
is *strongly* recommended that an alternate recovery (programmer, DFU, etc)
method is available in the event that something goes wrong during deployment.
If coming from a stock bootloader it is also recommended that the user create
a backup before proceeding.

To build the deployer set the `Build CanBoot deployment application` option
in the menuconfig to your existing bootloader offset.  The additional settings
apply to the CanBoot binary, configure them just as you would without the
deployer.  Save your settings and build with `make`.

This will result in an additional binary in the `out` folder, `deployer.bin`.
Flash `deployer.bin` with your existing bootloader (SD Card, HID, an older
version of CanBoot, etc).  Once complete, the deployer should reset the
device and enter CanBoot.  Now you are ready to use CanBoot to flash an
application, such as Klipper.

## Contributing

CanBoot is effectively a fork of Klipper's MCU source.  As such, it is appropriate
to retain similar contributing guidelines as Klipper.  Commits should be formatted
as follows:

```
filename: brief description of commit

More detailed explanation of the change if required.

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your email address>
```

All commits must be signed off with a real name and email address indicating
acceptance of the
[developer certificate of origin](/developer-certificate-of-origin).

## Notes
- It is recommended to USB CAN device flashed with
  [candlelight](https://github.com/candle-usb/candleLight_fw), such as a
  [Canable](https://canable.io/).
- If using a MCP2515 CAN Device (ie: Waveshare RS485 CAN HAT) it is possible
  that packets will be dropped when reading flash back from the node during
  the verification process.  That said, I have successfully tested the 12 MHz
  Crystal variant with the
  [recommended settings](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT).
- Details on the protocol used to communicate with the bootloader may
  be found in [protocol.md](protocol.md).
